                From a young boy, hiding under the covers with a flashlight, trying to find Waldo or devouring "The Big Book of Random Facts", I have loved information. For many years, my full-time job was listening to other's stories, finding ways to help them discover new ideas, and connecting those ideas to a lived experience.

                In preparing for the next chapter of my life I finished a software engineering program that has prepared me to ask good questions to understand a problem or need, utilize both current knowledge and research to collaboratively plan a solution, and execute that solution in an agile way that allows for adaptation as more information is received.

                I am loving using Javascript, React, and Redux to build user experiences that are smooth and intuitive. Building backends with both Node.js and Python, taking advantage of Flask and Express, and understanding the power and limitations of an ORM when writing SQL queries have been a joy.

                But one of the greatest joys in all of this is seeing my children's eyes light up when they get to use the new thing that "daddy" built.
